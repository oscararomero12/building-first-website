                    Hi, my name is Oscar Romero.
                    I'm Salvadoran and currently live in Hayward, California.
                    I was born in April 6th, 2001 and as of November 2022 I'm 21 years old.

                <p class="home-p">
                    I have many hobbies and interests.

                    soccer, football, baseball, brazilian jiu jitsu, swimming, cross-country, tennis,
                    among many others. I also love trying new things which includes hiking new trails,

                <h2 class="home-h2">My reason for wanting to become a software engineer</h2>
                <p class="home-p">
                    I want to become a software engineer because I love technology. I have been a part of
                    the audio/visual team at my church for over 3 years now. I love being able control the cameras,
                    lighting, microphones, streaming, and solving any problem that might come up because a day without
                    some sort of technical difficulty is the day I win the lottery. I know I have the resillience and creativity
                    neccesssary to be an asset to a company that's willing to hire me.
